# hello-world
Lets beggin.
Well, that´s good, lets start.
As the guide is asking me to make a pull request im going to talk a bit about me.
I am a spaniard guy on his 25. I have traveled around all West Europe and never been in english lessons.
I have always been autodidactic.
I have been around computer since I have memories and always love it but never went too far away into software.
I have mainly worked with hardware, when i was 13 and i made lan_partys with my friend we use to try to overclock
pentiums 1, 2 and 3 to make them explode by changing the volts with the jumpers of the mainboard... it never succed, but was funny.

Now i have worked and travel enough to realise that i dont want to keep on the hospitality sector and i could
make a change in my life, sadly, there is no programming school on the city that i live at the moment so i have no choice
that to learn by myself.

I moved to UK the first time when i was 17 to visit my sister in London, where i stayed for 2 weeks due to a huge blizzard that
affected to plains and that time was awesome.
I moved back after 6 month with some money and a backpack. I landed on gatwick and moved by bus to Brighton were i lived with squatters, in that time it was not forbidden in UK. Then, after 2 weeks of living and working i made money to buy a camera and hitchike to my friend´s place in Milan, Italy, where he was making the practise for his profesional course in Hospitality.
It took me 5 days.
Then, after that i have never stoped from traveling and working on the go.
That was 7 years ago.

Well, that is my introduction, i dont really want to write anymore, feel free to do whatever you want here or to do nothing, im going to keep on with the guide steps.
